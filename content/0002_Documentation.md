Summary: We are working on better documentation

Currently Veles ML algoritms are Neural Networks as [Znicz](https://github.com/Samsung/veles.znicz) plugin and Genetic Algorithm as Genetic in Veles core. Znicz is a submodule of Veles. Documentation about Znicz is located in Veles documentation. All you have to know about creating Neural Networks is in [Veles documentation](https://velesnet.ml/jenkins/job/VELES_Python_Veles_Tests/Veles_Machine_Learning_Platform_Documentation/). We will split Veles and Znicz documentation in the future. And we know, that our documentation should be much better. We are working on it. If you have any questions about instalation or using Veles, please ask me: Lyubov Podoynitsina (podoynitsinalv@gmail.com)
